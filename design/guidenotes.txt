-Gives users exactly what they were looking for when coming to the side, e.g. purchasing a product
 or finding information.


Bad: 
-Makes users believe the brand doesn't really care about their product or service;
-Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand
-Makes the brand or product seem "cheap"
-Leaves users confused, and it makes hard to for them to reach their goal

Typography

Definition- the art and technique of aranging type to make written language 
  legible, readable and appealing when displayed.

Serif vs Sans-serif

Serif: 
Creates a traditional/classic look and feel. 
Conveys trustworthyness. 
Good for long text.

Sans-serif:
Modern look and feel
Clean and Simple
Easer to choose for beginner designer

Typefaces:
(Can be taken from Google Fonts)
1: Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
  Sans-serif: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans Lato
  Serif: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora
2: Its completely OK to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
3: Choose the right typeface according to your website personality

Font-Sizes and Weights:
When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type scale" or other pre-defined range
Use a font-size between 16px and 32px for normal text.
For long text(like a blog post), try size of 20px or even bigger
For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+) depending on personality
For any text, dont use a font weight under 400 (regular)

Create a good reading experience:
Use less than 75 characters per lines
For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text go below 1,5
(The smaller and longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be!)
Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural
Experiment with all caps for short titles, Make them small and bold to increase letter-spacing
Usually, dont justify text.
Dont center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.

Colors: 
Color Theory goes in-depth in that avenue.


1: Make sure that the main color match your website's personality.
  Red- draws attention, symbolizes power, passion and excitement
  Orange- less agressive, conveys happiness, cheerfulness and creativity
  Yellow- means joy, brightness and ingeligence
  Green- harmony, nature, growth and health
  Blue- peace, trustworthyness and profesionalism
  Purple- wealth, wisdom and magic
  Pink- romance, care, affection
  Brown- associated with nature, durability and comfort
  Black- symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

2:Use a good color tone! Didn't choose a random tone or css named colors.
  Open Color can be used as tool for picking colors.
  Tailwindcss
  Flat UI colors 2

3: Establish a color system- you need at least 2 types of color in your color palette: 
  a main color and a grey color(it doesnt have to be grey-> can be a really dark version of a color).

4: With more experience, you an add more colors: accent colors (can be obtained by a tool )
5: For diversity, create a lighter and darker versions(tints(lighter) and shades(darker))
  pallenton.com, coolors, tint and shade generators
6: Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.
7: Use colors to add interesting accents or ake entire components or sections standout.
8: You can try to use color strategically in image and Illustrations

Colors and typography;
On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background("lighter version") for text
Text should usually NOT be completely black. Lighten if it looks heavy and uninviting
Dont make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors (Coolors-> Contrast ratio tool)
 -Contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text(18px+)
