Typography

Definition- the art and technique of aranging type to make written language 
  legible, readable and appealing when displayed.

Serif vs Sans-serif

Serif: 
Creates a traditional/classic look and feel. 
Conveys trustworthyness. 
Good for long text.

Sans-serif:
Modern look and feel
Clean and Simple
Easer to choose for beginner designer

Typefaces:
(Can be taken from Google Fonts)
1: Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
  Sans-serif: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans Lato
  Serif: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora
2: Its completely OK to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
3: Choose the right typeface according to your website personality

Font-Sizes and Weights:
When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type scale" or other pre-defined range
Use a font-size between 16px and 32px for normal text.
For long text(like a blog post), try size of 20px or even bigger
For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+) depending on personality
For any text, dont use a font weight under 400 (regular)

Create a good reading experience:
Use less than 75 characters per lines
For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text go below 1,5
(The smaller and longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be!)
Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural
Experiment with all caps for short titles, Make them small and bold to increase letter-spacing
Usually, dont justify text.
Dont center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.
