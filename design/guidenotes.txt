Good: 
-Creates an immediate and lasting good impression of the brand or product
-Makes the user trust the brand right away
-Increases the user's perceived value of the brand or product
-Gives users exactly what they were looking for when coming to the side, e.g. purchasing a product
 or finding information.


Bad: 
-Makes users believe the brand doesn't really care about their product or service;
-Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand
-Makes the brand or product seem "cheap"
-Leaves users confused, and it makes hard to for them to reach their goal

  medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines, and few images and icons.

  light-grey text and backgrounds, and rounded elements.

Typography

Definition- the art and technique of aranging type to make written language 
  legible, readable and appealing when displayed.

Serif vs Sans-serif

Serif: 
Creates a traditional/classic look and feel. 
Conveys trustworthyness. 
Good for long text.

Sans-serif:
Modern look and feel
Clean and Simple
Easer to choose for beginner designer

Typefaces:
(Can be taken from Google Fonts)
1: Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
  Sans-serif: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans Lato
  Serif: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora
2: Its completely OK to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
3: Choose the right typeface according to your website personality

Font-Sizes and Weights:
When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type scale" or other pre-defined range
Use a font-size between 16px and 32px for normal text.
For long text(like a blog post), try size of 20px or even bigger
For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+) depending on personality
For any text, dont use a font weight under 400 (regular)

Create a good reading experience:
Use less than 75 characters per lines
For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text go below 1,5
(The smaller and longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be!)
Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural
Experiment with all caps for short titles, Make them small and bold to increase letter-spacing
Usually, dont justify text.
Dont center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.

Colors: 
Color Theory goes in-depth in that avenue.


1: Make sure that the main color match your website's personality.
  Red- draws attention, symbolizes power, passion and excitement
  Orange- less agressive, conveys happiness, cheerfulness and creativity
  Yellow- means joy, brightness and ingeligence
  Green- harmony, nature, growth and health
  Blue- peace, trustworthyness and profesionalism
  Purple- wealth, wisdom and magic
  Pink- romance, care, affection
  Brown- associated with nature, durability and comfort
  Black- symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow

2:Use a good color tone! Didn't choose a random tone or css named colors.
  Open Color can be used as tool for picking colors.
  Tailwindcss
  Flat UI colors 2

3: Establish a color system- you need at least 2 types of color in your color palette: 
  a main color and a grey color(it doesnt have to be grey-> can be a really dark version of a color).

4: With more experience, you an add more colors: accent colors (can be obtained by a tool )
5: For diversity, create a lighter and darker versions(tints(lighter) and shades(darker))
  pallenton.com, coolors, tint and shade generators
6: Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.
7: Use colors to add interesting accents or ake entire components or sections standout.
8: You can try to use color strategically in image and Illustrations

Colors and typography;
On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background("lighter version") for text
Text should usually NOT be completely black. Lighten if it looks heavy and uninviting
Dont make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors (Coolors-> Contrast ratio tool)
 -Contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text(18px+)


Images

Different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, illustartions, patterns

Use images to support your website's message and story. Use relevant images! 

Prefer original images. If not possible, use-original looking stock images(not generic ones!)

Free images- Unsplash 

Try to show real peole to trigger user's emotions

If necessary, crop images to fit your message.

Experiment combining photos, illustartions and patterns

Handling text on images: 
  Method 1: Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)
  Method 2: Position text into neutral image area
  Method 3: Put text in a box(especially if you add opacity of the box)

Need to account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size(2x times scale factor)

Compress image for a lower file size and better performance- tool-> Squoosh to reduce size of images

When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have EXACT SAME DIMENSIONS.

Icons: 

Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icons packs:
  Phosphor icons, ionicons,icons8

Use only ONE icon pack. Dont mix icons from different icon packs

Use SVG icons or Icon fonts. Dont use bitap formats(jpg and png)
  -BITAP images- JPG, PNG, GIF- Do not scale and become unsharp
  -Vecror-based images- SVG images and icon fonts-> Scale indefinetely

Icons needs to adjust to your website's personality- Roundness, weight and filled/outlined depend on typography

Use icons to provide visiual asistance to text

Use icons for product feature blocks

Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)

Use icon as bullet points.

To keep icons neutral, use the same color as text, To draw more attention, use different color

Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action.

Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape.
